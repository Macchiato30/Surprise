    <p>To my Palangga❤️,</p>
    <p>It's been a month since we started dating, so I wanted to take this chance to tell you how much I love and appreciate having you in my life.</p>
    <p>You are the most incredible person I have ever met, and I am so grateful to be able to call you my own. Even though we're separated by a great distance, our journey together has been one of happiness, laughing, and innumerable wonderful memories.</p>
    <p>Here's to many more months filled with your love, humor, and experiences. I'm eager to find out what the future has in store for us. I love you so much langga ❤️</p>
